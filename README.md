# Istanbul_theaters_in_pandemic

Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation

I made this project to reveal the impact of the pandemic process on the entertainment industry. Since the entertainment industry is very large and includes many different branches, I made it using the theater plays data regularly updated by the Istanbul municipality.

File Descriptions

there are 2 files: first is raw data, second is jupyter notebook

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
